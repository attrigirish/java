Constructor


A constructor is a special member which is used to intialize an object of a class. 

Key Points:

1. A constructor function cannot be called explicitly.
2. A constructor gets called implicitly when an object of a class is created.
3. A constructor does not return any value.
4. A constructor can be parameterized or non parameterized.
5. A constructor is defined with the name of the class.


class XYZ
{
	public XYZ()
	{
		System.out.println("A New Object is Created");
	}
}


What will be output of this program


ArrayList<XYZ> lst = new ArrayList<XYZ>();

lst.add(new XYZ());
lst.add(new XYZ());


Create a class Register with following members:
	- id
	- name
	- email 
	- phone

	- An empty constructor to take input from the user.
	- A constructor to accpet values of id and name.
	- A constructor to accept values of id, name and email.
	- A constructor to accept values of id, name and phone
	- A constructor to accept values of id, name, email and phone.
	- A function Output to display the details of id, name, email and phone

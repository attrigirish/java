static Keyword

Java's static keyword can be used with either a variable or a function. 

static Variable

A static variable of also called class variable is used to share a common value amongst all the object of a class.


static Function

A static function can be used to access the static member of a class. Static function cannot access non-static members of a class.



Keypoints:

1. A static member (variable or function) can be used even without creating an object of a class.

2. A static member can only be accessed with it's class name.



class Bank
{
	private int acno;
	private String name;
	private static String branch;
	private float balance;

	public static void SetBranch(String b)
	{
		branch=b;
	}

	public void CreateAccount(int a,String n,float b)
	{
		acno=a;
		name=n;
		balance=b;
	}

	public void AccountDetails()
	{
		S.o.p("Account No : " + acno);
		S.o.p("Name : " + name);
		S.o.p("Balance : " + balance);
		S.o.p("Branch : " + branch);
	}
}


... main()
{
	Bank.SetBranch("Pitampura");

	Bank c1 = new Bank();
	Bank c2 = new Bank();

	c1.CreateAccount(12345,"Girish Attri",50000);
	c2.CreateAccount(12346,"Ravi Verma",60000);

	c1.AccountDetails();
	c2.AccountDetails();

}
